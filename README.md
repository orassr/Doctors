Description:

The "CSV to Excel Data Processor" is a web-based API developed in C# using the ASP.NET Core framework, 
designed to efficiently process and transform data from CSV files into formatted Excel spreadsheets. 
This tool is particularly useful for handling structured data, such as resident records, and converting them into a more versatile and user-friendly format.
Key Features:

    CSV File Upload: Users can upload CSV files with specific data structures (such as resident information).
    Data Processing: The API reads CSV files, extracts relevant information, and processes it according to predefined business logic.
    Dynamic Excel Generation: Generates Excel files with customized headers and formats. The headers include dynamic elements like the current date, and specific columns are populated based on the CSV data.
    Error Handling and Validation: Robust error handling ensures reliable processing, and data validation maintains the integrity of the input.
    Secure and Scalable: Built with security and performance in mind, the API is suitable for handling large datasets and sensitive information.

Technologies Used:

    ASP.NET Core: For creating a robust and scalable web API.
    C#: As the primary programming language for backend development.
    CsvHelper: For efficient parsing and processing of CSV files.
    ClosedXML: To create and manipulate Excel files, allowing for complex formatting and data structuring.
